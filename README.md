# SFDX  App

This is the sfdc side of the audition application located here: https://github.com/cowie/auditionFormApp 

## Dev, Build and Test

First, pull this down and deploy via SFDX.

Next, go here - https://github.com/cowie/auditionFormApp and hit the button to create your Heroku app.

Now, in your sfdx project directory, do a happy 
sfdx force:user:password:generate 
This will give you the credentials you need to set up Heroku Connect.

Once you've got that - go into Heroku Connect, set up a mapping as follows, using the credentials SFDX gave you.

Now you good. Go to the main site, hit record, make a recording, then once that's done the submit button will enable itself. Emails and IDs are unique, so don't screw that up. Once it's in, flip to the org and you'll see the fun.
